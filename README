app

Issues / features would resolve with more time:

* I think the wakelock can be lost before the API call completes in the service if it runs slowly. 
A solution I found was to use a WakefulBroadcastReceiver, however this is deprecated in API 26.1.0+. Alternatives that work through dozemode might include GCM?
* Simple methods for the SDK end-user to restart, or cancel the comment log service.
